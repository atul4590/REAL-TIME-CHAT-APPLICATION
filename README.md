# Description
Objective
The primary objective of this task is to design and build a responsive and interactive chat interface that supports real-time messaging between users. The final product should offer a clean user interface, maintain a message history, and work seamlessly across different screen sizes. The chat interface should dynamically update without requiring manual page refreshes. This means when one user sends a message, it should instantly appear in the chat window of all connected users.

Key Features to Implement
User Interface (UI):

A modern, responsive layout using CSS or frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.

Message input field and send button.

Display of sent and received messages.

Time stamps on each message.

Differentiation of messages based on sender (e.g., color coding or alignment).

WebSocket Integration:

Connect to a WebSocket server upon opening the application.

Handle sending and receiving messages through the WebSocket connection.

Display received messages instantly in the chat window.

Graceful handling of connection loss or failure.

Message History:

Store and display previous messages in the chat.

Optionally use a back-end or local storage to preserve messages across sessions.

Multiple User Support:

Enable communication between two or more users.

Show typing indicators or user join/leave notifications (optional).

Code Quality:

Well-structured and commented code.

Use of components in React or Vue for modularity.

Logical state management for chat data.

Tools and Technologies
React.js or Vue.js: To build the UI and manage component logic.

WebSocket API: For real-time data transmission.

CSS/SCSS/Tailwind CSS: For styling the chat interface.

Optional Backend: Node.js with socket.io can be used if you wish to set up your own WebSocket server.

Deliverables
A fully functional real-time chat application.

Clean, intuitive UI with responsive design.

Persistent or dynamic message history display.

Source code hosted on GitHub with appropriate documentation.

Proper code comments for readability and understanding.

Learning Outcomes
This task will provide interns with essential knowledge of:

Real-time web technologies.

State and event handling in modern JavaScript frameworks.

Building scalable and interactive user interfaces.

Implementing asynchronous programming patterns.

Using GitHub for version control and code sharing.

By completing this task, interns will gain practical experience that is directly relevant to real-world software development, especially in areas like social media, messaging platforms, and customer support applications.
